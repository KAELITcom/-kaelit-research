# KAELIT High-Level Architecture Overview

> *This document outlines the modular structure and core components of KAELIT's blockchain design. No proprietary source code or implementation logic is included.*

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

KAELIT is built around three uncompromising principles:

- **Quantum Resistance**: Future-proof security using CRYSTALS-Kyber and Dilithium
- **AI Optimization**: Modular AI for real-time gas tuning, anomaly detection, and performance prediction
- **Scalability by Design**: A hybrid Layer-1/Layer-2 model using zk-Rollups, DAG-based sharding, and stateless validation

---

## 🧩 Core Components

### 🔐 Cryptographic Layer
- **PQC Integration**: Hybrid encryption using Kyber (key exchange) + Dilithium (signatures)
- **Fallback ECC**: Optional support for ECDSA to maintain wallet compatibility

### ⚙️ Consensus Layer
- **DAG-Based Sharded Ledger**: Parallelizable consensus structure to eliminate bottlenecks
- **BFT Finality Engine**: Byzantine Fault Tolerance on shard leaders
- **zk-Rollup Anchoring**: Validity proofs anchor each epoch snapshot to the main chain

### 🧠 AI Optimization Layer
- **Gas Prediction Module**: LSTM or Transformer models to dynamically tune gas per transaction type
- **Anomaly Detection Engine**: Isolation Forest & Graph-based heuristics for runtime abuse monitoring
- **Adaptive Parameter Engine**: Deep RL tuning of validator performance, block size, and epoch cycles

### 🧱 Execution Layer
- **Rust-Based Modular Runtime**: Built with Tokio & mpsc for async performance
- **WASM Smart Contracts**: CosmWasm + Ink! compatible, with embedded AI agent hooks
- **Stateless Validation**: Enabling clients to validate without full history replay

### 🌐 Interoperability Layer
- **IBC Protocol Support**: Inter-blockchain communication channels
- **Cross-VM Support**: Bridge modules for EVM, WASM, and Move-based chains
- **Meta Layer Hooks**: Dynamic fee market adaptation based on external L2 oracles

## 🔒 What’s Not Public (Yet)

- zk-SNARK/zk-STARK circuits and zero-knowledge proof system
- AI training datasets and transformer weights
- Consensus finality conditions and validator reward algorithm
- Rust codebase and node implementation

These are under active R&D and will be shared with strategic development partners only.
