# KAELIT – Modular Blockchain Infrastructure (2022–2025)

**KAELIT** is a quantum-secure, policy-orchestrated blockchain architecture  
developed independently in Korea between 2022 and 2025.  
This repository presents a conceptual snapshot of the system’s high-level modular layout.  
No source code, algorithmic structures, or implementation logic are disclosed.

---

## 🧠 Design Overview

KAELIT is built on three core principles:

- **Quantum Resistance:** Future-ready cryptography (PQC)
- **Adaptive Coordination:** Runtime-level tuning for performance and security
- **Scalability by Design:** zk-Rollups, DAG-based sharding, and stateless execution

---

## 🧩 Modular Architecture Layers

- **Cryptographic Layer** – Hybrid post-quantum encryption (Kyber + Dilithium)  
- **Consensus Layer** – DAG-structured parallel ledger with epoch anchoring  
- **Adaptive Optimization Layer** – Tuned system behavior (internal mechanisms not disclosed)  
- **Execution Layer** – Rust-based async runtime, WASM smart contracts  
- **Interoperability Layer** – IBC, cross-VM bridge, and dynamic fee logic

---

## 🔒 What’s Not Public (Yet)

To protect patent-pending innovations, the following are intentionally withheld:

- zk-SNARK/STARK circuit designs  
- Adaptive controller structures and coordination parameters  
- Reward tuning algorithms and scheduling policies  
- Validator finalization logic and Rust node codebase

These components are under active research and may be shared with strategic partners under NDA.
